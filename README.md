# Bread Baking Adviser

The Bread Baking Advisers is a tool that can be used by bakers to carefully calculate the amount of bread that should be baked per day. Because a bakery needs to provide fresh bread every day, and therefore limit loss, it will always want to bake an amount of bread that is most sufficient. But at every bakery, it’s always a challenge to estimate how much bread will be sold every day. 

The Bread Baking Adviser is a tool that can be used by bakers to calculate the most sufficient amount of bread every day. It works fairly simple: Every day, the baker needs to input the amount of every type of bread that was baked, into the tool. At the end of the day, the baker inputs the amount of every type of bread that is left over. The more data has been inputted over time, the better the advice the tool will give. This way, a baker can get a good overview of how much they sell and how much bread they should prepare to bake every day. This will allow the baker to produce more efficiently and decrease loss.

## UX

The main user type of the Bread Baking Advicer is bakers. It is developed for bakeries and will be used by their employees and is therefore of little to no use for any other type of user. The UX of the tool will therefore solemnly targeted at this user type.

Since the goal of the app is fairly simple, the tool will be developed as a website that can be accessed easily by employees of the bakery and provide them with the needed advice as simple as possible. Therefore, the website will be developed as mobile first, so that users of the tool can access it easily when needed without the use of a computer. However, if needed the website can be accessed using a laptop or desktop computer as well. All data that will be input and viewed, should be displayed on one page as much as possible.

To simplify the initial development process, the tool will be designed for a specific bakery called The Bakery Café that is located in Groningen, the Netherlands. In a later stadium, the functionalities of the tool can be extended so that it can be used by all bakeries.

### The Bakery Café baking process

To make sense of the user stories in the next section, it should be mentioned that the bread baking process can be divided into three days at The Bakery Café and is as followed:

#### Day 1

The right amount of bread is placed on several bread wagons. There is a max of 40 pieces of bread per bread wagon. The bread wagons are then placed in the freezer until the next day. As for the use of the Bread Baking Advicer, this would be the moment to check for advice on the right amount of bread that should be placed on the bread wagons.

#### Day 2

The bread wagons are taken out of the freezer and semi-defrosted so that they can be decorated. After that, the bread wagons will be placed into the proofing unit.

#### Day 3

The bread wagons are taken out of the proofing unit and are ready to be baked. They will be placed into the oven. As for the use of the Bread Baking Advicer, this would be the moment to input the amount of bread that will be baked that day.

### User Stories

1.	Bakery employees want to check advice on how many bread pieces should be placed on the bread wagon at day 1, so that they can bake a sufficient amount of bread pieces on day 3.
2.	Bakery employees want to check if the amount of bread that should be baked that day is correct.
3.	When the bread wagons are placed into the oven, bakery employees want to input the amount of bread that is baked into the Bread Baking Advicer tool so that the tool will take this into its calculation.
4.	Bakery employees want to input the amount of bread pieces that are left at the end of the day into the Bread Baking Advicer tool so that the tool will take this into its calculation.
5.	Bakery employees want to see an overview of the average amount of bread that is baked every week so that they can adjust their weekly order of bread pieces.

### Mockups

Even though it is possible to view the website on a desktop computer, it is designed to be used on mobile devices only. Therefore, only mockups for a mobile first version were created.

### Design

•	Primary colours were derived from the colours of The Bakery Café website and corporate identity. 

•	The font that is used for the website is called ‘Traveling Typewriter’. It is the corporate identity font of the Bakery Café.

•	The ‘Bread Baking Adviser’ logo has been created in InDesign using the Bakery Café logo on the website, combined with the Traveling Typewriter font.

## Features

### Existing Features
•	A tab at the top of the website with 3 clickable tabs;

•	A dropdown button where the user can click on the day to be viewed;

• The dropdown button automatically detects the current day of the week and adjusts itself;

•	Advice section - This tab provides information about the amount of bread to be placed on the bread wagons and the amount of bread to baked that day;

• Input section - On this tab, the user is able to input and submit the amounts of bread that were baked and left ober on the selected day. It will check if the data is valid and then sends it to an external API;

• Overview section - This tab provides two horizontal barcharts; one about the amount of bread that was consumed last week, and one about the amount of bread that was consumed last four weeks. This section also provides advice on how much boxes should be ordered weekly, based on the weekly bread consumption;

• Documentation - The ReadMe file and Mockups;

• Responsive design;

• Accessibility - Simple transactions of information;

• Branding;

• Git Version Control;

• Hosted on GitHub pages;

• A Favicon icon.

### Features Left to Implement

•	Submitted data cannot be edited or deleted. In the future, this feature will be implemented;

• A feature that gives the user the ability to add or delete breadtypes, so it can be used by different bakeries;

• A feature that gives the user the ability to indicate if a special event is taking place. Thus, more or less bread will be calculated based on this.

• A feature that gives the user the ability to define how much bread should be added in the next calculation when a bread is sold out. For example, if a type of bread is sold out, the bread baking advisor will take into account that at least one more bread should be baked next time. In the future, the user can adjust this amount;

• A feature that gives the user the ability to define how much bread should at least be baked. For example, if not more than two pieces of a type of bread were sold in four consecutive weeks, it will want to advice not to bake more than two. However the user will be able to define the minimum amount of bread that should be baked.

• A feature to view graphs of specific types of bread. The user will be able to see a timeline of the consumption of a type of bread in the last 4 weeks for a specific day.

## Testing

### Advice section

1. Users want to see how much bread they need to put on the bread wagon on the current day.
    1. When the page is visited the current day is automatically viewed. This has been tested on all days of the week.
    2. When another day is selected, all data changes immediately according to the selected day.
    3. All viewed amounts of bread are checked with the API it is loaded from. All numbers are viewed at the correct spots.
    4. Different data files with different amounts were tested to see if all calculations are done correctly. For example, all values were set to 5. This way it is easy to spot if something is miscalculated and if the averages are correct.
    5. The total amounts of bread are checked with different data values and are calculated correctly.

2. Users want to switch between the Advice, Input and Overview section.
  1. When clicked on the tabs at the top of the page the user is redirected to the correct page.
  2. When clicked on the 'Overview' button at the bottom of the page, the user is redirected to the overview page immediately.
  
### Input section

1. Users want to edit or input the amounts of bread.
  1. When clicked on the input space, the space is automatically emptied for ease of use and to prevent the user from entering too many digits.
  2. The user is only able to enter a number between 0 and 40. This is defined in the form element. If the user does manage to enter a number that is not between 0 and 40 (for example by using copy-paste) and tries to submit it, an error message will pop up at the bottom of the page to point out that the user should input a number between 0 and 40.
  3. The user cannot submit an empty field. If the user uses backspace to delete the value in the form and leaves it empty when submitting, an error message will pop up at the bottom of the page to point out that all fields need to contain a value.
  4. The user cannot submit a letter or a float. When the user tries to submit this, an error message will pop up at the bottom of the page to point out that the user should input numerical value and that it should be an integer.
  5. The user cannot submit a negative value. When the user tries to submit this, an error message will pop up at the bottom of the page to point out that the user should input a positive value.
  6. The user cannot submit more leftover bread than baked bread. In other words: if the value in the left column is lower than the corresponding value in the right column, an error message will pop up at the bottom of the page to point out that leftover bread cannot be higher than the amount of baked bread.

2. Users want to submit their inputted data.
  1. When the inputted data is not valid according to the above described rules, the data won't be sent.
  2. When data has already been submitted for a certain day, the submit button will turn grey and displays the text: 'Already submitted'. This refreshes every day. For example, if a user enters data on a tuesday, for that tuesday, it can not be submitted again that tuesday. On wednesday, if needed, the user will be able to submit new data for tuesday. Because it is likely that several employees are at work on a certain day, it should be prevented that more than one user submits data for a certain day. 

*Note: The bread baking advisors remembers all the data for a specific day, for all types of bread, for a total of four weeks. When new data is submitted, it forgets the data of week 4 and replaces it with the data of week 3. Data of week 3 becomes data of week 2, and data of week 2 becomes data of week 1. The newly submitted data is stored in week 1. Should it happen that data is submitted for a certain day more than once, the weeks will shift according to this system and the total amounts for that day wont be as accurate anymore. To prevent this from happening, a date is viewed above the submit button so the user can see when the data for a specific data has been updated most recently. I am aware that this is not the most solid system, but at the point of developing it seemed to complex to change this system. As described in the 'Features left to implement', it is planned to develop a system for editing data to make the system more solid.*
