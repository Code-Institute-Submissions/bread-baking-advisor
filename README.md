# Bread Baking Adviser

The Bread Baking Advisers is a tool that can be used by bakers to carefully calculate the amount of bread that should be baked per day. Because a bakery needs to provide fresh bread every day, and therefore limit loss, it will always want to bake an amount of bread that is most sufficient. But at every bakery, it’s always a challenge to estimate how much bread will be sold every day. 

The Bread Baking Adviser is a tool that can be used by bakers to calculate the most sufficient amount of bread every day. It works fairly simple: Every day, the baker needs to input the amount of every type of bread that was baked, into the tool. At the end of the day, the baker inputs the amount of every type of bread that is left over. The more data has been inputted over time, the better the advice the tool will give. This way, a baker can get a good overview of how much they sell and how much bread they should prepare to bake every day. This will allow the baker to produce more efficiently and decrease loss.

## UX

The main user type of the Bread Baking Advicer is bakers. It is developed for bakeries and will be used by their employees and is therefore of little to no use for any other type of user. The UX of the tool will therefore solemnly targeted at this user type.

Since the goal of the app is fairly simple, the tool will be developed as a website that can be accessed easily by employees of the bakery and provide them with the needed advice as simple as possible. Therefore, the website will be developed as mobile first, so that users of the tool can access it easily when needed without the use of a computer. However, if needed the website can be accessed using a laptop or desktop computer as well. All data that will be input and viewed, should be displayed on one page as much as possible.

To simplify the initial development process, the tool will be designed for a specific bakery called The Bakery Café that is located in Groningen, the Netherlands. In a later stadium, the functionalities of the tool will be extended so that it can be used by all bakeries.

### The Bakery Café baking process

To make sense of the user stories in the next section, it should be mentioned that the bread baking process can be divided into three days at The Bakery Café and is as followed:

#### Day 1
The right amount of bread is placed on several bread wagons. There is a max of 40 pieces of bread per bread wagon. The bread wagons are then placed in the freezer until the next day. As for the use of the Bread Baking Advicer, this would be the moment to check for advice on the right amount of bread that should be placed on the bread wagons.

#### Day 2
The bread wagons are taken out of the freezer and semi-defrosted so that they can be decorated. After that, the bread wagons will be placed into the proofing unit.

#### Day 3

The bread wagons are taken out of the proofing unit and are ready to be baked. They will be placed into the oven. As for the use of the Bread Baking Advicer, this would be the moment to input the amount of bread that will be baked that day.
